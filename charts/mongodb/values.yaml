# BACKUP & RECOVERY
# ==================================================================================
# This section is for documentation only. MongoDB backups are performed manually
# via Makefile targets (make -f make/ops/mongodb.mk mongo-*-backup).
# See: docs/mongodb-backup-guide.md for comprehensive backup/recovery procedures.
#
# Backup Components:
# - Database Data: mongodump, all databases or selective (Critical)
# - Oplog: mongodump --oplog for PITR (Critical, replica sets only)
# - Configuration: mongod.conf, ConfigMaps, Secrets (Important)
# - Users & Roles: system.users, system.roles collections (Important)
#
# Backup Methods:
# - mongodump: Regular backups, selective database support, PITR with oplog
# - PVC Snapshots: Fast storage-level snapshots via VolumeSnapshot
# - Filesystem Copy: Hot backup with fsync lock
# - Replica Set Delayed Secondary: Continuous replication with time delay
# - MongoDB Cloud Manager/Ops Manager: Enterprise automated backups
#
# Quick Commands:
#   make -f make/ops/mongodb.mk mongo-full-backup          # All components
#   make -f make/ops/mongodb.mk mongo-backup-database      # Database data
#   make -f make/ops/mongodb.mk mongo-backup-oplog         # Oplog (replica sets)
#   make -f make/ops/mongodb.mk mongo-backup-config        # Configuration
#   make -f make/ops/mongodb.mk mongo-backup-users         # Users & roles
#
# Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) / Recovery Point Objectives (RPO):
# - Database Dump: RTO <1 hour, RPO 24 hours
# - Oplog Backup: RTO <30 min, RPO 15 minutes (replica sets)
# - Configuration: RTO <15 min, RPO 24 hours
# - Users & Roles: RTO <15 min, RPO 24 hours
# - Full Disaster Recovery: RTO <2 hours, RPO 24 hours
# - Point-in-Time Recovery: RTO <1 hour, RPO 15 minutes (replica sets with oplog)

# ==================================================================================
# UPGRADE PROCEDURES
# ==================================================================================
# This section is for documentation only. MongoDB upgrades are performed manually
# via Helm upgrade commands with pre/post validation via Makefile targets.
# See: docs/mongodb-upgrade-guide.md for comprehensive upgrade procedures.
#
# Upgrade Strategies:
# 1. Rolling Upgrade (Zero Downtime):
#    - For replica sets (3+ nodes)
#    - Secondaries upgraded first, then primary
#    - Recommended for production deployments
#    - Downtime: None
#
# 2. In-Place Upgrade (Planned Downtime):
#    - For standalone deployments (1 node)
#    - Simple upgrade with brief service interruption
#    - Downtime: 5-15 minutes
#
# 3. Blue-Green Deployment (Minimal Risk):
#    - Deploy new cluster parallel to existing
#    - Test thoroughly before cutover
#    - Instant rollback capability
#    - Downtime: <1 minute (DNS/traffic switch)
#
# 4. Dump and Restore (Major Version Jumps):
#    - Export data, upgrade MongoDB, import data
#    - Recommended for major version jumps
#    - Downtime: 1-4 hours (depends on data size)
#
# Pre-Upgrade Checklist:
#   make -f make/ops/mongodb.mk mongo-pre-upgrade-check   # Validation
#   make -f make/ops/mongodb.mk mongo-full-backup         # Backup all components
#
# Post-Upgrade Validation:
#   make -f make/ops/mongodb.mk mongo-post-upgrade-check  # Automated validation
#
# Rollback:
#   make -f make/ops/mongodb.mk mongo-upgrade-rollback    # Helm rollback
#
# Important Notes:
# - Feature Compatibility Version (FCV) must be upgraded after binaries
# - FCV upgrade is irreversible without restore
# - Test upgrades in non-production environment first
# - Review MongoDB release notes for version-specific changes
# - Ensure driver compatibility (application dependencies)
#
# Version-Specific Notes:
# - MongoDB 6.0 → 7.0: Improved Time Series, new aggregation operators, driver updates required
# - MongoDB 5.0 → 6.0: Time Series GA, native array filters, improved sharding
# - MongoDB 4.4 → 5.0: Native time series, versioned API, removed geoNear/mapReduce
